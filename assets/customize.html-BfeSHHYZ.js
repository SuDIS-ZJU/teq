After each call to the <code>endProcess</code> method, TEQ will automatically calculate and aggregate metrics such as the processing speed for each data group in the main process. Each process will have a UUID to identify it, which will be returned by the <code>beginProcess</code> method and needs to be passed into the <code>endProcess</code> method. In this way, you can collect almost all the metrics you want during each run.</p><h2 id="transform-metrics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#transform-metrics"><span>Transform Metrics</span></a></h2><p>To convert the collected metrics into the desired ones, you need to inherit from the <code>SendingMetricsReceiver</code> class and override the <code>finishStream</code> method.
